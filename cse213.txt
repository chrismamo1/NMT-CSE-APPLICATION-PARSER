Previously worked for the department (followed by the reason): Yes; Tutored two semesters, TA'd two semesters, graded 113 one semester and then 122 a different semester, and became a member of KevnEvnI. :)  Also, i'd prefer to tutor late at night (think 9pm or later) monday or tuesday. I have had slots at 9pm-11pm or 9pm-12am tuesday for the duration of the time i've been a tutor, and it would be badass if I could keep that up, ya know??
